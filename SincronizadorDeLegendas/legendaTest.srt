1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,628
You have something I want.

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,925
<i>It means more to me</i>

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>than you will ever know.</i>

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,598
<i>The Child is gone.</i>

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,684
Until he is returned to you safely,
we are in your debt.

6
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,523
Cara Dune,
Marshal of the New Republic.

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,943
I need you to locate someone
in the prison registry.

8
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,279
Ex-Imperial sharpshooter,
last name Mayfeld.

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,865
Serving 50 years
in the Karthon Chop Fields.

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,785
Accessory to the death
of a New Republic officer.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,662
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando!

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,747
Realize
what you'll bring down on us?

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,957
You think I care about that?

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,459
- Get that blaster out of my face.
- I can't do that.

15
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,506
Crazy Twi.

16
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,972
No!

17
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,871
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven.

18
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,791
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven.

19
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,461
What? What?

20
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,174
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,
descend and receive new instructions.

21
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,891
Can't you see I'm busy?

22
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,227
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,

23
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,021
please salute Marshal Dune.

24
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,236
I remand prisoner number
three-four-six-six-seven to my custody.

25
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,781
Affirmative.
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,

26
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,242
please follow Marshal Dune to transport.

27
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,412
-Somebody gonna tell me what's going on?
-Let's go! I've got a job for you.

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,960
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,
please follow Marshal Dune.

29
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,419
Wait, where is she takin' me?

30
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,879
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,

31
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,550
you have three seconds
to comply with your new directive.

32
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,510
Okay! All right, all right.

33
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,637
Hey!

34
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,890
You gonna tell me where you're takin' me?

35
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,934
Hello?

36
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,772
I mean, it's a common courtesy,

37
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,234
a common courtesy to tell somebody
where it is that you're takin' 'em.

38
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,695
I don't think
that's so hard to ask, do you?

39
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,743
You know, for a second,
I thought you were this other guy.

40
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,756
Mayfeld.

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,301
Hey, Mando.

42
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,761
Long time.

43
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,472
What, you came here to kill me?

44
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,809
All you need to know is I bent
a lot of rules to bring you along.

45
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,103
Why am I so lucky?

46
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,897
Because you're Imperial.

47
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,024
Hey, that was a long time ago, all right?

48
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,109
You still know
your Imperial clearances

49
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,111
and protocols, don't you?

50
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,113
We need coordinates
for Moff Gideon's cruiser.

51
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,407
Moff Gideon?

52
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,909
Yeah, forget it.

53
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,453
Just take me back to the scrapyard.
I'm not doin' that.

54
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,746
They have his kid.

55
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,374
The little green guy?

56
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,626
Yeah, "The little green guy."

57
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,545
So...

58
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,383
I help you guys get him back,
you guys let me go?

59
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,927
That's not how this works.

60
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,679
Well, then what's in it for me?

61
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,180
You get a better view.

62
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,104
All right, but here's the thing.
I can't get those coordinates

63
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,940
unless I have access
to an internal Imperial terminal.

64
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,901
I believe there's one on Morak.

65
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,362
Morak?
There's nothing on Morak.

66
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,447
It's a secret Imperial mining hub, okay?

67
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,826
If you can get me in there,
I can get you the coordinates.

68
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,791
Fett,
punch in the coordinates to Morak.

69
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,336
Copy that.

70
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,427
I did an initial scan of the planet.

71
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,263
This is what you're talkin' about, right?

72
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,473
Yeah, that's the refinery right there.

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,602
Wonder what they're refining in there.

74
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:56,356
Looks like rhydonium.
Highly volatile and explosive.

75
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,484
Yeah, kinda like this one.

76
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,449
They have anti-aircraft cannons
protecting it.

77
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,659
And a platoon of security forces.

78
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,413
So we go in quiet.
Let's go get a closer look.

79
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,474
I'm not gonna need long inside,

80
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,894
so once I get the coordinates, you guys
gotta get me the hell out of there.

81
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,438
You get to the roof.
I'll drop in and pull you out.

82
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,566
All right. Mayfeld and I will swap out
for the drivers in the tunnel.

83
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,319
As much as I'd like to take a road trip
with Rebel-dropper here,

84
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,695
that's not gonna work.

85
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,322
Yeah? Why's that?

86
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,659
Well, because these Remnant bases
are set up and run by ex-ISB.

87
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,161
If you get scanned
and your genetic signature

88
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,664
shows up on any New Republic register,

89
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,166
you're gonna be detected,
and it's guns out.

90
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,710
You sure do know
a lot about Imperial Remnants.

91
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,046
If you wanna accuse me of something,
then just say it.

92
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,257
We don't have time.
Fennec will go.

93
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,301
No, I'm wanted by the ISB.
I'll trip the alarm, too.

94
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,512
Fett?

95
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,556
Let's just say
they might recognize my face.

96
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,307
Great, so it's me goin' in alone.

97
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:13,809
No way.

98
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,603
The minute he gets inside,
he'll tip 'em off. He'll be a hero.

99
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,773
Hey. This wasn't my idea.
I'm doin' you guys a favor.

100
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,567
Deal's off.
I'm takin' him back.

101
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,319
I'll go.

102
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,196
Hey, buddy,
I might be good at fast-talking,

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,284
but I don't think I can explain away
a guy in a Mando suit to Imperial guards.

104
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,202
So, unless
you're gonna take off that helmet,

105
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,704
it's gonna be me goin' in alone.

106
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,206
Or say goodbye
to your little green friend.

107
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,876
You're not going alone.

108
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,587
I'm coming with you.

109
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,382
But I won't be showing my face.

110
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,978
Refinery, this is Juggernaut Five
entering tunnel T-12.

111
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,271
<i>Copy that.</i>

112
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,857
<i>Juggernaut Four has reached</i>
<i>the north exit. You're all clear.</i>

113
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,209
What the...

114
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,055
My God, this guy reeked.

115
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,474
His gloves are still wet.

116
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,148
Look at this.

117
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,817
The shame.

118
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,780
Now, that right there
is worth the price of admission.

119
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,451
Wish I could say it looked good on you,
but I'd be lying.

120
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,620
Just make sure
you take out the rooftop gunners,

121
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,330
or we're never getting out of here.

122
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,831
We got you.

123
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,628
Take care of this. Keep it safe.

124
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,004
I will.

125
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,757
Hey, guys. Still on the clock.

126
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,636
What would they say on Mandalore?

127
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,181
It's a shame
you're not comin' along with us.

128
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,725
You got such a sunny disposition.

129
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,103
Can't imagine how much fun you are
in one of these.

130
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,147
What's goin' on here?

131
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,526
Power coil, motivator...

132
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,194
There we...

133
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,155
There we go. There we go!

134
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,324
And we are off.

135
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,254
Hey, how's it feel?

136
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,011
I mean, c'mon, man,
you still get to wear a helmet, right?

137
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,141
All right, you know what?
I'm takin' this thing off.

138
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,310
I can't see anything.

139
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,314
I don't know
how you people wear those things.

140
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,525
And by "you people,"
I do mean Mandalorians.

141
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,840
Phase one, complete. We're in.

142
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,468
<i>Copy. Standing by.</i>

143
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,604
Feels better when it's off.

144
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,339
<i>Juggernaut Four,</i>
<i>you're running hot.</i>

145
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,716
<i>Be sure to watch</i>
<i>your cargo heat limits and speed.</i>

146
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,262
<i>Copy that, Three. We hit</i>
<i>a couple bumps. Thanks for the heads-up.</i>

147
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,306
Don't worry about the rhydonium.

148
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,477
As long as you drive steady,
you'll get us to the refinery.

149
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:42,870
Go, go!

150
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,123
- Out of the road. Go!
- Get to safety!

151
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,391
Yeah. Empire, New Republic.

152
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,185
It's all the same to these people.

153
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,104
Invaders on their land is all we are.

154
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,277
I'm just sayin',

155
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,031
somewhere someone in this galaxy
is ruling and others are being ruled.

156
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,449
I mean, look at your race.

157
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,660
Do you think all those people
that died in wars fought by Mandalorians

158
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,870
actually had a choice?

159
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,706
So how are they any different
than the Empire?

160
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,085
If you were born on Mandalore,
you believe one thing,

161
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,546
if you're born on Alderaan,
you believe somethin' else.

162
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,131
But guess what?

163
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,425
Neither one of 'em exist anymore.

164
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:46,391
Hey, I'm just a realist.
I'm a survivor, just like you.

165
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,977
Let's get one thing straight.

166
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,771
You and I are nothing alike.

167
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,983
I don't know. Seems to me like your rules
start to change when you get desperate.

168
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,360
I mean, look at ya.

169
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,987
You said
you couldn't take your helmet off,

170
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,949
and now you got a stormtrooper one on,
so what's the rule?

171
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,370
Is it that you can't take off your
Mando helmet, or you can't show your face?

172
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,996
'Cause there is a difference.

173
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,878
Look, I'm just sayin', we're all the same.

174
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,550
Everybody's got their lines
they don't cross until things get messy.

175
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,636
As far as I'm concerned,
if you can make it through your day

176
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,180
and still sleep at night,
you're doin' better than most.

177
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,307
<i>Control, this is Juggernaut Three.</i>

178
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,059
<i>We're comin' up</i>
<i>on some route interference.</i>

179
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,437
<i>- Control, control!</i>
<i>- We need a new...</i>

180
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,522
What was that?

181
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,440
<i>Please stand by for reroute.</i>

182
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,322
<i>Juggernaut Four has been destroyed.</i>

183
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,407
"Destroyed"?

184
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,659
The rhydonium is still stable.

185
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,870
<i>Juggernaut Five,</i>
<i>maintain speed and course.</i>

186
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,079
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

187
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,416
<i>-Re-routing course, stand by.</i>
-"Proceed with caution"? Is she serious?

188
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,169
<i>Control,</i>
<i>this is Juggernaut Three. Requesting...</i>

189
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,045
<i>Abort! Abort! </i>

190
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,187
What the hell was that?

191
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,692
Pirates. Keep driving.
I'll take care of it.

192
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,992
Are you seriously
shooting a blaster near rhydonium?

193
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,371
They've thermal detonators.

194
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,332
- Terrific.
- Just keep it steady.

195
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,126
Get these guys off us!
Get 'em off us!

196
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,523
-They're trying to blow the rhydonium.
-You think?

197
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,734
You should've left me in prison!

198
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,957
Mayfeld! Pick it up. Drive faster!

199
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,892
I don't think faster's a good idea!

200
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,146
What are you doing?

201
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,472
Mando, I gotta stop.

202
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,140
I can't cross at this speed.

203
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,098
Whoo!

204
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,359
Go! Go!
Stay on high alert!

205
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:32,487
Fire! On your right!

206
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,728
Never thought you'd be happy
to see stormtroopers.

207
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,079
Here they are.
They made it.

208
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,331
Yes!

209
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,178
Glory of the Empire!

210
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,062
There we go!

211
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,481
Okay. All we gotta do is find a terminal.

212
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,404
Ya did it!

213
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,866
Bringing glory to the Empire!

214
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,784
It's probably in the officers' mess.

215
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,500
I can't believe they pulled that off.

216
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:17,968
There it is.

217
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,429
- Okay.
- Good luck.

218
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,777
- I can't go in there.
- Why not?

219
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,155
-That's Valin Hess.
-Who?

220
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,532
It's Valin Hess.
I used to serve under him.

221
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,326
- Will he recognize you?
- I don't know.

222
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,662
I was just a field operative,
but I'm not takin' the chance. It's over.

223
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,332
Let's just do this quick
and we can get out of here.

224
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,084
I can't do it, okay?
We have to abort. I'm sorry.

225
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,753
No. I can't.

226
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,632
If we don't get those coordinates,
I'll lose the kid forever.

227
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,801
-Give me the data stick.
-It's not gonna work.

228
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,770
In order to access the network,
the terminal has to scan your face.

229
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,065
Let's go.

230
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,608
Give it to me.

231
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,355
<i>Error, error. Facial scan incomplete.</i>

232
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,233
<i>Ten seconds to system shutdown.</i>

233
00:21:56,316 --> 00:22:00,904
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

234
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:05,033
<i>five, four, three, two...</i>

235
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,245
<i>Facial scan complete.</i>

236
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,056
Trooper!

237
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,902
Hey, trooper.

238
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,198
Pay attention
when a superior addresses you.

239
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,742
What's your designation?

240
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,037
Transport crew.

241
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,789
What?

242
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,667
My designation is transport copilot.

243
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,252
No, son.

244
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,048
What's your TK number?

245
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:06,345
My TK number is...

246
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,348
This is my Commanding Officer
TK-593, sir.

247
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,269
I'm Imperial Combat Assault Transport
Lieutenant TK-111, sir.

248
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:16,688
I'm afraid you'll have to
speak up to him a little bit

249
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,941
since his vessel lost pressure in Taanab.

250
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,781
What's your name, Officer?

251
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,828
We just call him Brown Eyes.
Isn't that right, Officer?

252
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:36,124
Let's go fill out those TPS reports,
so we can go recharge the power coils.

253
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,876
You're not dismissed.

254
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,472
You the tank troopers
that delivered the shipment of rhydonium?

255
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,058
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

256
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:10,117
Well, you two managed to be the only
transport today to deliver their shipment.

257
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:15,873
Come with me?

258
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:23,797
Let's get a drink, Brown Eyes.

259
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,191
We'll have to take out those cannons

260
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:45,110
if Boba's gonna get close enough
to lift 'em outta there.

261
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,738
Shouldn't be a problem.

262
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,574
You concentrate on the troopers,
I'll take the cannons.

263
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,456
I wonder what's takin' them so long.

264
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,334
So what shall we toast to, boys?

265
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:07,424
I can blather on about
"To health" or "To success,"

266
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,555
but I'd like to do
somethin' a little less rote.

267
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:16,517
Where you from, Brown Eyes?

268
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,398
How 'bout a toast to Operation Cinder?

269
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,945
Now there's a man who knows his history.

270
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,822
No, I don't just know it. I lived it.

271
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:33,784
I was in Burnin Konn.

272
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,495
Burnin Konn?

273
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:38,705
That was a hard day.

274
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,459
I had to make many unpleasant decisions.

275
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,545
Yes, you did.

276
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,259
Entire city gone in moments,
along with everybody in it.

277
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,554
We lost our whole division that day.

278
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,431
Man, that was like 5-10,000 people.

279
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:58,642
Yep.

280
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,311
All heroes of the Empire.

281
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:02,521
Yeah.

282
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,189
And all dead.

283
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,527
Well, it's a small sacrifice
for the greater good, son.

284
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,614
Depends on who you ask, don't you think?

285
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,367
What you gettin' at, trooper?

286
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:18,412
All those people, the ones who died,

287
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,164
was it good for them?

288
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,876
Their families?

289
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,461
The guys I served with?

290
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:32,676
Civilians, those poor mud scuffers,
died defendin' their homes,

291
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,387
fighting for freedom.

292
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,514
Was it good for 'em?

293
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,728
But we've outlasted them, son.

294
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,480
They're eatin' themselves alive.

295
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:50,652
The New Republic is in complete disarray,
and we grow stronger.

296
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,989
You see,
with the rhydonium you've delivered,

297
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:59,328
we can create havoc that's gonna make
Burnin Konn just pale by comparison.

298
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,748
And then they're gonna
turn to us once again.

299
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,757
You see, boys,
everybody thinks they want freedom,

300
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,887
but what they really want is order.

301
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,642
And when they realize that,

302
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:26,355
they're gonna welcome us back
with open arms.

303
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,240
To the Empire.

304
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,219
You did what you had to do.

305
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,888
I never saw your face.

306
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,022
<i>Security to main commons.</i>

307
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:13,485
This way!

308
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,571
We need support at the mess hall.

309
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,700
Ready? Go!

310
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,244
Hold it right there!

311
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,089
South wall, halfway up.

312
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,008
Got 'em.

313
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,143
We're on. Start your run.

314
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,270
On my way.

315
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,624
Three shooters, top deck.

316
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,167
Got 'em.

317
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,384
- Let's move.
- The hell you think I'm doin'?

318
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,269
Go! Go! Go! Go!

319
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,627
Hand me that cycler rifle.

320
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,189
Nice shot.

321
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,572
We all need to sleep at night.

322
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,334
We got company.

323
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,503
Hang on.

324
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,958
Well, looks like
it's back to the scrap heap.

325
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,590
Thank you for helping.

326
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,217
Yeah.

327
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,178
Good luck gettin' your kid back.

328
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,140
All right, Officer,

329
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:32,684
take me back.

330
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,521
That was some nice shootin' back there.

331
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:36,813
You saw that?

332
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,233
Yeah, that,
that wasn't part of the plan.

333
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,653
I was just gettin' some stuff
off my chest.

334
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:49,451
You know, it's too bad Mayfeld
didn't make it out alive back there.

335
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,328
Yeah, too bad.

336
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:53,997
What are you talkin' about?

337
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,584
Looked to me like prisoner number
three-four-six-six-seven

338
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:00,087
died in the refinery explosion on Morak.

339
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,300
Does that mean I can go?

340
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,179
'Cause I will.

341
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:17,563
All right.

342
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,731
Okay.

343
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,490
You get the coordinates on Moff Gideon?

344
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:29,575
We did.

345
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,410
What's our next move?

346
00:32:58,604 --> 00:32:59,605
Sir...
